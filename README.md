# DonorsChoose.org Application Screening

The goal is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. This information can then be used to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.

Metric: AUC
